# k-Means-clustering

In this project i use K-means clustering to create a colour approximation of an image.

This image is read and is treated as a three element feature vector (RGB) of unsupervised data. I then perform K-Means clustering of the pixels and then re-coloured using the median of each colour component calculated within the clusters.

If you wish to run this code i would advise to use the ***parrot_small.jpg*** as this will speed up the run time
